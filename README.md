# kdlf-python-markdown-extentions
Extensions for python-markdown, made for use on kyadlfiles.github.io  
Since these were made for a single website, they may not be the most well-written extensions out there  
But feel free to use or improve upon them if you find them useful

## WARNING
The shortcuts may change or their behaviour may change unexpectedly as I update them for my needs
